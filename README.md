Hey I'm Mateo Quotteri and this is my profile:


Fristly I have to say that i'm 17 and argentinian, i am so attracted by tech and the revolution of the web3, blockchain, Bitcoin and Crypto.
My dream is that one day (when the whole economy is based on Ethereum) to be a software and smart contract developer.
I love football and I am fan of Racing Club (a popular club in Argentina).
I have my own Podcast in which i talk and explain everything about cryptocurrencies and Blockchain. (in spanish)
